The more you work on your project in isolation, the better your ideas will sound to you -- even the bad ones. Listening to your ideas spoken out loud in your own voice is an excellent sanity check, and feedback from your peers is your most valuable resource.*\n",

The unit can be in any type of residence such as a house, apartment, mobile home, or may also be a single unit in a group of rooms. Essentially, a housing unit is deemed to be a separate living quarter where the occupants live and eat separately from other residents of the structure or building.
